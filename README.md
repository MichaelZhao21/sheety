# Sheety

Based off of our [HackUTA 2024 project](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/hacktua24), I want to be able to convert piano videos (falling tiles specifically) to sheet music. Although Spotify did already do this (audio -> MIDI), it was quite generalized and thus not the best for outputting clear sheet music.
